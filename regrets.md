# Preface

I’ve recently been inspired by [Scott Berkun’s](https://twitter.com/berkun) book [The Myths of Innovation.](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449389627/tag=scottberkunco-20) In particular, the quote at [location 3278](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoffbrown/motivations/master/list.png) on the Kindle Ebook that reads:

> “Once a week, imagine being on your deathbed (it can be fun: think Mexican Day of the Dead). Ask yourself: what will I regret not having done if I knew I was going to die today? Make a list and get to work.”

Additionally, I’ve always been inspired by [Buster Benson’s](https://twitter.com/buster) dedication to self-reflection and transparency. In particular, Buster’s [Codex Vitae.](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex2015.md)

*Note: With full apologies to Buster, I’m inspired to create my own list of beliefs as well.*

I’ve recently decided to marry the two of these ideas (the general idea behind Scott’s quote and Buster’s display of transparency on Github) into a public list of *post mortem* “regrets.” The idea being, of course, that I won’t regret these things if I take action.

I’ve also decided that I want to update this list as often as I see fit, but with the goal of not having this document become too unwieldy. Review will consist of adding and removing items to this list, and I’ll be giving myself a friendly reminder to re-read and update on a regular basis.

# Regrets

If I die today, I’ll most likely regret that I have never done the following (mostly) concrete things:

*Note: my aim for this list is to preemptively enumerate dying regrets, not a list of tasks or goals that should live in a to-do list.*
